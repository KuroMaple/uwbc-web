# Whats this?
uwbc-web is a custom web tool developed to streamline the regular ongoings at University of Waterloo Badminton Club (UWBC). UWBC is one of the most popular clubs on campus and has regular turnouts of 50+ members per session. 

Each session a team of club executives use a physical board of player tags and excel spreadsheets to rotate members on and off courts. It is sometimes difficult to manage these sessions with a physical board, and this web app will make the lives of both UWBC executives and members easier!

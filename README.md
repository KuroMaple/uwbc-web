## What's This?

`uwbc-web` is a custom web tool designed to modernize and streamline the day-to-day operations of the **University of Waterloo Badminton Club (UWBC)**. As one of the most popular clubs on campus, UWBC sees regular turnouts of 50+ members per session. Managing such a large group effectively has always been a challenge, but this app aims to simplify things for both the **club executives** and **members**.

---

### Why Build This?

During each session, a team of club executives traditionally uses **physical player tags** and **Excel spreadsheets** to rotate members on and off courts. While this system works, it can be time-consuming and prone to errors. With `uwbc-web`, these processes are digitalized, making sessions easier to manage while improving the overall member experience.

### Features

- **Court Management**  
  Organize players across courts seamlessly. Automatically track rotations, wait times, and available courts.

- **Interactive Tutorial**  
  A built-in demo walkthrough helps new users quickly understand and use the app.

- **Session Insights**
